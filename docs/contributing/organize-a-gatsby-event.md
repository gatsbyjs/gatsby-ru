Our communiy event support offerings and process are undergoing some changes. Check back soon to see our updated community event support opportunities!

## What constitutes a Gatsby event?

A community organized Gatsby event can be a local meetup, a small conference, a _lunch and learn_ with coworkers, or a larger event. It’s up to you how many people you want to invite and how casual the environment. You can organize an event at your workplace or for the local community.
